"""
Hangman Game Module.

This module implements the classic Hangman game where the player guesses
letters to figure out a secret word. It includes features such as selecting
a random word from a predefined list, displaying the current progress of
the word with correctly guessed letters, tracking correct and incorrect
guesses, limiting the number of incorrect guesses before the game ends,
and providing options to play the game again.

Functions:
- select_random_word(word_list): Picks a random word from the list.
- display_word_progress(word, guessed_letters): Shows the word with
  underscores for unguessed letters.
- get_user_guess(): Prompts the user to enter a single letter and validates
  the input.
- play_hangman(): Runs the main Hangman game loop.
- play_again(): Asks if the player wants to play another round.

Dependencies:
- random: For selecting a random word.
- os: For clearing the terminal screen.
- time: For adding delays between messages.
