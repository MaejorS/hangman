Hangman Game Module

This module contains the implementation of the classic Hangman game where the player 
guesses letters to figure out a secret word. The game includes the following features:

- Selecting a random word from a predefined list.
- Displaying the current progress of the word with correctly guessed letters.
- Tracking correct and incorrect guesses.
- Limiting the number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.
- Providing options to play the game again.

Functions:
- select_random_word(word_list): Picks a random word from the given list.
- display_word_progress(word, guessed_letters): Displays the word with underscores for unguessed letters.
- get_user_guess(): Prompts the user to enter a single letter and validates the input.
- play_hangman(): Runs the main Hangman game loop.
- play_again(): Asks the player if they want to play another round.

Dependencies:
- random: For selecting a random word from the list.
- os: For clearing the terminal screen.
- time: For adding delays between messages.
